## 🧩 Gameplay

- Match **3 or more** tiles of the same type to pop them. Tiles need to be adjacent, but need not be in a straight line.
- Each combo triggers a minimalist animated effect.
- The higher the combo, the more satisfying the feedback.
- The game saves your high score. Unlock subsequent levels by reaching their score thresholds.
